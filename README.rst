ZenIRCBot API
=============

This is where the API libraries for ZenIRCBot will live and be
developed. I decided to put them outside of the core as I couldn't
find an obvious place to put them. There will be a directory for each
language. If you contribute a language, please use the full name of
the language (javascript, not js)

I welcome pretty much any language, though if you contribute bindings
for a language I don't know I may tap you on the shoulder to do code
reviews if/when I need to add or modify it.

The docs will continue living in core for now but I can't promise that
it will stay that way.
